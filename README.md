# Cockroach-Poker
# Made for CSC-260 Final Project
This project is based on the card game Cockroach Poker.  You can play with 2 or 4 players.  Each player is given a set of cards that contain eight different bugs on them.  On the player's turn, he or she chooses a card to play against another player face down.  The first player will either lie about the bug on the card or tell the truth.  The second player guesses if the bug declared is True or False.  If the player's guess is correct, the first player places the card face up in front of himself.  If the guess is incorrect, that player places the card face up in front of herself.

Additionally, a player can choose to Pass the card presented to him or her.  In this case, the player looks at the card, chooses a new player to target, and can either tell the truth or lie.  The target player goes through the same process as above.  Cards can not be passed to the same player more than once.  The first player to have four cards face up in front of him or her with the same but loses.
